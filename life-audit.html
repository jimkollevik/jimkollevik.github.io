		<p class="default-font dark-grey">I’m a big fan of simple, minimalistic products. I’m also passionate about productivity and constantly striving to improve—day by day, week by week, year by year. So when I stumbled upon Notion through a random Instagram post, I was instantly intrigued. It felt so intuitive, so simple, yet incredibly powerful.</p>

		<h1 class="default-font">Baby steps</h1>
		<p class="default-font dark-grey">It was the summer of 2023, and the year hadn’t started off great for me. I was craving change, and Notion seemed like a potential candidate. I created an account and started exploring, but I’ll be honest—it was confusing at first. Was it like Word, but more dynamic? Or Miro, but with databases?<br><br>

		Determined to figure it out, I began following Notion creators on Instagram. Their stunning templates and creative use cases inspired me, and I wanted in. I downloaded a few templates, tinkered with them, and slowly started to understand how everything worked.</p>

		<h1 class="default-font">My First Major Creation</h1>
		<p class="default-font dark-grey">Fast forward a year, and I was fully immersed in Notion. By autumn 2024, I had not only mastered the platform but also began creating my own templates to design solutions tailored to my goals and needs.<br><br>

		In late 2024, I launched my very first public template on the Notion Marketplace. Shortly after, I followed up with another—The Life Audit Template—just before Christmas. Its timing was perfect, but its impact was even more significant. I created it for people seeking change, just as I had been, and it resonated with so many others.</p>

		<h1 class="default-font">Some metrics</h1>	
		<p class="default-font dark-grey">Since launching Life Audit, it has reached over 1,000 views and more than 500 downloads. It’s been rated 4.8 out of 5 by the Notion community, and I’ve continued to build and release more templates since then.
